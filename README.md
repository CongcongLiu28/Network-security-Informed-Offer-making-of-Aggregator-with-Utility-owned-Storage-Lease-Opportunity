There is a modified version of Assumption 4 that adds more detail.

Assumption 4: To ensure market fairness, this paper assumes that the shared energy storage (SES) operator refrains from engaging in electricity market transactions. The variability in charging and discharging behaviors among different energy storage lessees may result in the generation of surplus energy. To mitigate the risks of overcharging within the SES system, the SES operator signs a dynamic trading agreement with a large consumer capable of adjusting its electricity consumption patterns flexibly. Under this agreement, the SES operator can sell the surplus energy at a predetermined price, which can be the forecasted clearing price or the actual settlement price. Additionally, the initial state of charge for the SES is established at half of its rated capacity, as provided by the SES operator.
